# Introduction

PUC8a is an accumulator-based microcontroller with 8-bit registers. It is used in the
ENG1448 course of PUC-Rio. This is the assembler and C compiler
infrastructure for it.

# Instruction set architecture

This very simple processor is a Harvard design, with 8-bit instructions and 8-bit data values.
Both instruction and data memories have 256 addresses.

## Registers

There are 16 registers. `r14` is `sp`; `r15` is `pc`. The C compiler uses `r13` as `fp`.

## Instructions

All ALU instructions set flags.

| Opcode(4)  | Data(4) | Mnm | Effect | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0000 | rs | LDA  | acc <- [rs]                        | `lda  r0`    |
| 0001 | rd | STA  | [rd] <- acc                        | `sta  r0`    |
| 0100 | 0000 | LDI  | acc <- [pc+1], pc <- pc + 1      | `ldi  42`    |
| 0101 | cond | B  | if cond then pc <- [pc + 1] else pc <- pc + 1 | `bcc  42`    |
| 0110 | rs | GET  | acc <- rs                        | `get  r0`    |
| 0111 | rs | SET  | rs <- acc                        | `set  r0`    |
| 1000 | rs | ADD  | acc <- acc + rs                       | `add  r0`    |
| 1001 | rs | SUB  | acc <- acc - rs                       | `sub  r0`    |
| 1010 | rd | INC  | rd <- rd + 1                       | `inc  r0`    |
| 1011 | rd | DEC  | rd <- rd - 1                       | `dec  r0`    |
| 1100 | rs | AND  | acc <- acc & rs                       | `and  r0`    |
| 1101 | rs | OR  | acc <- acc \| rs                       | `or  r0`    |
| 1110 | rs | XOR  | acc <- acc ^ rs                       | `xor  r0`    |
| 1111 | rs | SHFT  | if (rs >= 0) acc <- acc << rs else acc <- acc >> -rs | `shft  r0`    |

## Pseudo-instructions

| Pseudo-instruction | Actual instruction |
|---|---|
| `beq` | `bz` |
| `bne` | `bnz` |
| `bhs` | `bcs` |
| `blo` | `bcc` |

## Condition codes

| Condition | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0000 | Unconditional |
| 0001 | Zero flag set |
| 0010 | Zero flag not set |
| 0011 | Carry flag set |
| 0100 | Carry flag not set |
| 0101 | Signed less than |
| 0110 | Signed greater than or equal |

# Assembly language

Assembly statements generally follow the following structure
```asm
[LABEL:] MNEMONIC [OPERAND[, OPERAND]...]
```
The available `MNEMONIC`s can be found in the table above. `OPERAND`s can be registers, constants, or labels. Labels used as operands must be prefixed with `@`:
```asm
loop: b @loop
```
When the operand is used as the contents of a memory address, it must be enclosed in square brackets:
```asm
ldi @inp
set r0
lda [r0]
.section data
inp: .db 0
```
Apart from these statements, the assembler recognizes the following directives:

- ```asm
  .include "FILE"
  ```

  Includes a given `FILE`. The path is relative to the file being processed.

- ```asm
  .section SECTION
  ```

  Define into which memory `SECTION` the subsequent code is assembled. Options are `code` and `data`. The default is `code`.

- ```asm
  .org ADDRESS
  ```

  Sets memory `ADDRESS` at which the subsequent code will be assembled.

- ```asm
  .equ LABEL VALUE
  ```

  Creates a `LABEL` for a specific constant `VALUE`. Values may be character constants, e.g. `"c"`

- ```asm
  .db VALUE
  ```

  Inserts a `VALUE` into the instruction stream. The value may be a string constant, e.g. `"Hello, world"`

- ```asm
  .macro NAME
  ; code
  .endmacro
  ```

  Defines a macro. The code inside the macro can use arguments of the form `$0`, `$1`, etc., which are replaced by the actual arguments when the macro is called using `NAME arg0, arg1`. Labels inside the macro that start with an underscore are localized such that the same macro can be called multiple times.
